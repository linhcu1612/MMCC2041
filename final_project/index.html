          <p>
            Chess has a vast history that stretches back many years, decades,
            and even centuries! But who invented the game that we all love? What
            was the genesis of this well-known mental practice that millions of
            people participated in?
          </p>
          <p>
            Chess is well-known and widespread worldwide, yet its foundations
            and origins are unclear and widely contested. Several tales,
            anecdotes, and informed guesses range from where chess originated to
            when it was developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, most people think that a single person did not form the
            established game since it is simply too complicated with all its
            rules and principles for any fundamental human mind to produce. One
            of those older games was chaturanga, a Sanskrit term for a military
            formation found in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Chaturanga
            flourished in northern India by the 7th century. It is the earliest
            forerunner of modern chess since it had two crucial elements with
            all later chess variants: various pieces had varying strengths, and
            success was centred on one piece, the contemporary chess king.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next several decades, the game expanded throughout Asia and
            Europe, finally evolving into what we now call chess around the 16th
            century. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The chess game was constantly upheaval until Wilhelm Steinitz became
            the first declared World Chess Champion in 1886. When we consider
            today's chess, we will struggle to recognise it: from a game driven
            by intuitive decision-making to a battle between chess computers.

        <h2>Chess development over the time</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <article>
          <p>
            Chess underwent several changes and withstood penalties by the
            Christian Church as well as total prohibitions from time to time
            until the end of the 15th century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chess grew in popularity over the world, and chess sets were
            standardised in the mid-nineteenth century. Prior to the 1850s,
            chess sets were not at all standardised. In 1849, Jaques of London
            (a toy and game company) produced a new kind of pieces designed by
            Nathaniel Cooke. These same pieces were endorsed by Howard
            Staunton, the strongest player of his time. This unique style of
            piece, known as the Staunton pattern, became instantly popular and
            was used in tournaments and clubs worldwide. The Staunton pieces,
            and minor variations, are still considered the standard for
            tournament chess sets. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Until the 1880s, the game evolved into the modern, regarded as the
            "romantic chess age." Chess gradually developed a competitive aspect
            and specific rules, gaining appeal among the general public.
            Strategic planning and in-depth study of the theory were minor
            themes. There were concerns in the foreground, such as fast tactical
            themes and reliance on intuitive manoeuvres.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first chess competitions were held, and in 1886, the first
            official World Championship was held, with Wilhelm Steinitz becoming
            the first recognised World Chess Champion.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were romantic chess trends until the middle of the twentieth
            century when players depended on tactics and particularly dynamic
            play. However, the introduction of databases, chess engines, and
            many ways for pleasant and efficient strategical preparations in the
            twentieth century revolutionised chess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chess websites and online games were created to bring the romantic
            age to a close and usher in a new technological, digitalised era.

            The human-computer chess competition began in the mid-twentieth
            century. In 1949, Claude Shannon, widely regarded as the pioneer of
            modern IT, wrote a research article titled "<a
              rel="noreferrer noopener"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786445008521796?journalCode=tphm18"
              >Programming a Computer For Playing Chess</a
            >" He described the first-ever chess engine algorithm in history in
            the paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many computer engines were built on Shannon's work, although they
            were nowhere near as powerful as computers today. Until the 1970s,
            computers could barely compete with amateurs and could not compete
            with expert players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chess masters repeatedly harassed computers at the time. In 1968, IM
            David Levy wagered that a chess computer engine would not be able to
            defeat him for the following ten years. In 1978, he successfully
            cashed in 3000 US dollars since computers could not compete with
            human pattern recognition and intuition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The voyage to teach computers to play chess began in the 1980s, when
            personal computers became widely available. As demand for chess
            software grew, businesses began to invest in its development. Soon
            after, computer-only competitions were created, with prizes granted
            to the first computer to reach the master level and defeat the world
            champion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for computer scientists, during the 1980s, Kasparov
            won every game against chess computer engines.

        <h2>Deep Blue and its battle against world champion</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <article>
          <p>
            In the early 1990s, a group of IBM computer scientists created Deep
            Blue, a chess engine capable of exploring 200 million chess
            positions per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep Blue vs. Kasparov was the first match in 1996. Kasparov won the
            war for humanity once more, as he did in the 1980s, with a score of
            4 to 2. That was the last occasion a human defeated a machine in a
            chess game. Soon afterwards, IBM planned a rematch for the next year
            (1997). Deep Blue was more prepared this time, with a more powerful
            CPU and a more vigorous opening repertoire. The encounter was
            conducted in New York's Equitable Center so that everyone may
            witness the outcome of a struggle that began 50 years before the
            first chess engine was developed. Kasparov won the first game using
            the KID (King's Indian Defense), leading IBM computer experts to
            mistrust Deep Blue's abilities. Current engines struggle with
            "understanding" some KID situations where experienced players might
            develop miraculous combinations to assault the enemy's king.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately for Deep Blue and IBM, Kasparov made a massive blunder
            after the second game and lost. Historians think this was the
            tipping point that shifted the balance of power in favour of our
            favourite chess engines. The following three games (3-5) were drawn
            out as Kasparov attempted to battle back but could not convert.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contest quickly progressed to game six (and the last). In the
            Caro-Kann Defense, Kasparov used a questionable version. Perhaps
            Deep Blue assumed Deep Blue would not make the necessary knight
            sacrifice to get the advantage as White. Deep Blue's opening tree
            proved Kasparov's proved wrong, which crushed him in 18 moves.

        <h2>Is The Game of Chess Solved?</h2>

          <p>
            Despite the superior power of chess engines and AlphaZero's
            innovative artificial intelligence-based chess, chess remains far
            from being solved. For chess to be solved permanently, every
            position must be identified, evaluated, and played in practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists relate the number of potential chess positions to the
            number of atoms in the cosmos. To solve chess, you must be able to
            compute far more chess positions than present computers, and we,
            sadly (or not), do not yet have a quantum computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, even if we solve it and record everything for future
            generations to study, it may be hard for the human brain to recall
            and absorb such a large quantity of knowledge.
